## Project Overview

Automated Answer Evaluation simplifies the evaluation of descriptive answers by leveraging machine learning models and NLP algorithms. It aims to enhance assessment accuracy and speed, benefiting educators and institutions.

## Features

- **Automated Evaluation:** Automatically assesses descriptive answers based on predefined criteria.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizes NLP techniques for text preprocessing and analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements ML algorithms (such as SVM, LSTM) to evaluate answer quality.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle a large number of answer scripts efficiently.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction and result visualization.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks:**
  - TensorFlow
  - Scikit-Learn
  - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
  - OpenCV
  - Tkinter (for GUI)
  - PyPDF2 (for PDF handling)
- **Database:** MySQL (for storing answer scripts and metadata)
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/automated-answer-evaluation.git
   cd automated-answer-evaluation
   ```
2. **Setup virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare Answer Key:
Ensure the answer key is correctly formatted for the system.

2. Run the Application:
```bash
python main.py
```

3. Upload Answer Scripts:
Use the GUI to upload answer scripts in PDF format.

4. Evaluate Answers:
The system will process and evaluate answers, displaying results in the GUI.
